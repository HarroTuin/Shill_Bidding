This project revolves around the Shill Bidding Dataset, gathered from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Shill+Bidding+Dataset.
<br/>
<br/>
**Record ID:** Unique identifier of a record in the dataset.<br/>
**Auction ID:** Unique identifier of an auction.<br/>
**Bidder ID:** Unique identifier of a bidder.<br/>
**Bidder Tendency:** A shill bidder participates exclusively in auctions of few sellers rather than a diversified lot. This is a collusive act involving the fraudulent seller and an accomplice.<br/>
**Bidding Ratio:** A shill bidder participates more frequently to raise the auction price and attract higher bids from legitimate participants.<br/>
**Successive Outbidding:** A shill bidder successively outbids himself even though he is the current winner to increase the price gradually with small consecutive increments.<br/>
**Last Bidding:** A shill bidder becomes inactive at the last stage of the auction (more than 90\% of the auction duration) to avoid winning the auction.<br/>
**Auction Bids:** Auctions with SB activities tend to have a much higher number of bids than the average of bids in concurrent auctions.<br/>
**Auction Starting Price:** a shill bidder usually offers a small starting price to attract legitimate bidders into the auction.<br/>
**Early Bidding:** A shill bidder tends to bid pretty early in the auction (less than 25\% of the auction duration) to get the attention of auction users.<br/>
**Winning Ratio:** A shill bidder competes in many auctions but hardly wins any auctions.<br/>
**Auction Duration:** How long an auction lasted.<br/>
**Class:** 0 for normal behaviour bidding; 1 for otherwise.
